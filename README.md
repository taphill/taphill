A Software Engineer based out of Nashville, TN and student at the Turing School of Software and Design. I'm currently working primarly with ruby and rails, but love exploring new technologies! I value working with people who are kind and treat others with fairness and respect. Feel free to have a look around and reach out to me with any questions!
