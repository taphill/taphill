## Hello! I'm Taylor(he/him) 👋

### About

A Software Engineer based out of Nashville, TN, and graduate of the Turing School of Software and Design. I'm currently working primarily with Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL databases, but I love exploring new technologies! I value working with people who are kind and treat others with fairness and respect. Feel free to have a look around and reach out to me with any questions!
